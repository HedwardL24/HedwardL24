            <h3>Section 1</h3>
            <p>The planning phase for a software project is one the crucial phases in the software
		development life cycle. This phase consists of setting up the goals of the project, instructing
		tasks to fellow group members, and establishing a communication plan. Poor planning will result
		in delays and more cost outcomes while proper planning will lead to a successful project
		execution.<br>
		
		To start with planning, you have first to define the project goals clearly. These goals
		should always tie back into the business of the organization. This vision helps drive the decision
		of the company during the project as well as serve as a bar for success.<br>
		
		Next, you should involve stakeholders in the planning process. By involving
		stakeholders, we can make sure that the goals are captured and anticipated by everyone. There
		are different kinds of stakeholders: clients, project sponsors, and team members.<br>
		
		Next, you should implement the agile and waterfall method. The agile method
		emphasizes flexibility. This approach involves adapting your plan based on feedback or
		changing requirements. The waterfall method is a linear approach. This method requires
		documentation and clear milestones.<br>
		
		Then you should create a project schedule. It is important to have a project timeline to
		enable teams to maintain focus and stay on track. “Breaking down projects into smaller
		components can identify inconsistencies and trach progress easier.”<br>
		
		Finally, you should also plan out your budget in the planning phase. Budgeting is an
		important aspect of resource allocation. A well-prepared budget outlines expect costs and
		infrastructure. It is great to involve financial stakeholders to help ensure that the budget aligns.
		<br>
		
		To conclude, success begins with proper planning in the software project life cycle. This
		includes everything from creating clear objectives to gathering materials and resources. By
		involving stakeholders in the planning process, you can create a project that meets your
		expectations and organizational goals.<br>

        <h3>Designing</h3>
		<p>The next step in a software project life cycle is designing. This stage involves creating
		blueprints for the software architecture as well as creating user interfaces and system
		interactions. A well-created design process ensures the final project aligns with the user’s needs
		and business goals. The software design process can be broken up into three levels of design:
		Interface, architectural, and Detailed.<br>
		
		The specification of a system’s interaction with its surroundings is known as interface
		design. When it comes to the internal workings of the system, this design operates at a high level
		of abstraction. The interaction between the system and the user is the main focus of attention.<br>
		
		The specification of a system’s main constituents, along with its function is known as
		architectural design. The internal workings of the main components are disregarded in favor of
		the system’s overall framework. Architectural design adds features that are overlooked in the
		interface design. The design of the main components however are neglected until the end of the
		design process.<br>
		
		Finally, the specification of all key system components underlying aspects, including
		their algorithms and data structures is known as detailed design. This plan includes drawings,
		schedules, and requirements that outline the scope of work for the project. Detailed designing
		ensures that the project is accurate and allows for customization.<br>
		
		In conclusion, the design process for a software project is a key process that translate into
		practical plans. Through the grasp of Interface, Architectural, and Detailed design, teams can
		provide detailed blueprints and ensure alignment with user needs and the company’s objectives.
		They create an atmosphere that encourages innovation and produces great-caliber software
		solutions.<br>

        <h3>Development</h3>
		<p>The development process of a software project is a through series of steps that turns basic
		ideas into fundamental software programs. Ensuring that the program fulfills user requirements,
		and is delivered punctually and within budget all depend on this procedure. The development
		process includes a range of techniques that aid teams in allocating resources, and producing
		software of the highest quality.<br>
		
		“The main purpose of SDP is to ensure a quality product is delivered to the end
		customer”. The goal is to give value and meet needs to the users. Organizations must develop as
		quickly as possible while also making sure the quality and its security don’t drop.<br>
		
		Software development refers to the systematic approach of creating software
		applications. The waterfall method is one of the most traditional approaches to software
		development. It follows with a linear approach requiring design, deployment, and maintenance.
		Before proceeding to the next stage, each one must be fulfilled. The agile method prioritizes
		iterative progress, which enables teams to adapt quickly.<br>
		
		There are around 10 stages in the software development process. From brainstorming
		ideas to system designing, to releasing it into the market. During the brainstorming stage, ideas
		are brought up due to input from the customer. Fast forwarding to system designing, the product
		is designed and built. Developers implement codes into the product to get it to function. The
		product is then released into the market for consumer use at the end of the stages.<br>
		
		To conclude, development is a software development life cycle is extremely important. It
		is crucial to deliver a product that will meet the user’s needs. The waterfall and agile methods
		can be integrated during this phase to ensure that the process remains on the user’s needs and to
		ensure adaptability in case failure happens.<br>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>The next stage of the software development life cycle is the testing stage. Software
		testing is a process that ensure all software has met its criteria and is ready for release. It is a
		crucial part of the software development life cycle because it ensures the quality of the project.
		As software becomes more complex, it is the standard for developers to try out their product
		before releasing it to the public.<br>
		
		The purpose of testing the software is to continuously improve the consistency and
		effectiveness of the product. “No software is perfect, and even the best ones have to be tested
		before they’re released to make sure that they meet the expectations of their users.” Each of the
		testing stages has a criteria to ensure accuracy and quality.<br>
		
		In the testing phase, developers must create a plan to describe their objectives they wish
		on accomplishing. This includes their setup and approach. Plans are used as a guide to make sure
		that all of their steps are carried out. After plans are made, developers must design and code their
		products. Designing is “all about building the framework.” Codes are then implanted into the
		product to ensure that it is user-friendly.<br>
		
		Next, developers must execute their plans. “ It is an essential part of quality assurance, as
		it allows developers to identify and fix bugs before release.” If bugs are found within the product
		then it will continuously have to be re-tested until it is fixed. Finally, after the product has been
		tested, results are then documented.<br>
		
		The testing stage of the software development life cycle is an important stage that makes
		sure software quality, reliability, and the user’s satisfaction are good. Through strict planning,
		developers can identify problems early within the product. As software continues to evolve,
		developers must ensure that software not only meets the user’s need and are also prepared for
		future challenges.<br>

        <h3>Deployment</h3>
		<p>The deployment stage of the software development life cycle is a structured process that
		implements software solutions in a environment. It includes all the steps and activities that are
		required make a software available to its intended users. The methods used by developers such as
		building and coding will impact the speed and quality of the finished product.<br>
		
		The purpose of software development is to ensure that softwares are functioning properly
		to be released to the public. To ensure this, developers must configure settings to suit the
		software’s needs and environment. It is vital to do this because it helps allow people to use their
		software for its intended purpose.<br>
		
		In the deployment stage, developers may sometimes release demos of their product. The
		intention for to gather feedback from their users. The feedback gathered can help inform for
		future upgrades. The most common way developers gather feedback is through surveys. After
		downloading and use an application, companies may ask you to leave a review and describe your
		experience. Developers can also use data analytics to monitor how people are interacting with
		their product.<br>
		
		Although the development stage can help developers, there are also challenged that
		appear throughout this stage. Many users are often resentful when seeing a new app for
		download. This can often increase the wait time for feedback from consumers. There can also be
		bugs that appear in the initial release. These bugs can lead to developers shutting down the
		servers for maintenance which can take quite some time.<br>
		
		To conclude, a software’s deployment stage fulfills a number of functions that are
		important for a software. In this stage, feedback for users is important for the future of the
		software. Developers must control incoming risk while also managing the software’s
		performance. Ultimately, a successful deployment lays the pathway for continuous improvement
		so the software can stay relevant for people.<br>

            <h3>Maintance</h3>
		<p>In the landscape of software development, the software development life cycle does not
		end with the launch. Instead, the next step of the journey enters a stage called mainatanance.
		Maintananing is not only fixing a software, it is applying updates and upgrades to enchance its
		security and its performance. As softwares tend to live long, it is important that udates are
		applied to it to ensure that the core of the softerware is protected.<br>
		
		The maintanance phase consists of steps to follow similar to the softawre lifecycle itself.
		Developers are to identify the problem are figure how how it impacts their system.Then they
		create a plan on how to deal witht the problem and they implent that plan with action. Every
		security update is then tested out to ensure no further problems are created. Finally, the
		mainatance is documented for future uses.<br>
		
		There are 4 types of mainatance that can be done. Corrctive, Perfective, Adaptive, and
		Preventative. “Corrective maintenance is the category of maintenance tasks that are performed to
		rectify and repair faulty systems and equipment.” This is done to reduce interruptions within the
		software and extend its lifespan. “Adaptive maintenance is the implementation of changes in a
		part of the system.” It is like installing the updates so that the software is in a new version.<br>
		
		Perfective software is the adding of new features while lso removing unneccesary ones.
		This type of maintenance is usally given by customer feedback rather than errors within the
		software. Users might indicate that the software my be slow, so developers implentment codes
		that will make the software run faster. The final type of maintananance is preventative
		maintananace. Preventative maintananance is “about software changes and adaptations that
		reduce the risk of deterioration as software is operated for a long time.” As softwares ge, they get
		slower and their security goes down. It is important to optimize softwares so that users can use
		them at an appropriate speed withut have them lag.<br>
		
		To conclude, the maintanance phase is vital to the software development life cycle.
		Maintaining a software can help improve its life span. The 4 types of maintanance: Adaptative,
		Prevatative, Corrective, and Perfective can further improve the overall performanceand
		durability ofof softwares. As technology continues to grow, the importanace of mainatance will
		also improve as well, making it essential for developers to continually focus during this stage.<br>
